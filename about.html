    <h2 class="about-heading">About Swarm Effect</h2>
    <p class="about-p">Swarm Effect is a death metal band with two members separated by nearly 4000 km. Swarm Effect was founded in Kropyvnytskyi, Ukraine in 2016. That same year, they released a demo and played several concerts. They then took a long break as the members moved to different cities. During this time, guitarist Denys Burlaka played in another Kropyvnytskyi band, Killscream, while the vocalist moved to Portugal and continued to practice vocals. In 2023, the band decided to revive as a studio project, as the guys now live in different countries. Thus began a new chapter for the band.</p>
    <p class="about-p">They are now announcing their first release, recorded remotely. Swarm Effect will release an EP titled “Cotard’s Syndrome” consisting of 7 tracks. The recording work for the mini-album was carried out over a year, though the material was written much earlier, with some songs dating back to 2016. As this is now a purely studio project and they do not have a permanent drummer, the drum recording was done by session musician Krzysztof Klingbein from Poland (currently a session drummer for Belphegor and has also collaborated with Vader, Hate, Batushka). This was a pleasant collaboration for Swarm Effect, as their music resonated closely with the drummer, and the musicians shared a common vision for the sound, with no misunderstandings during the recording.</p>
    <p class="about-p">The track mixing was done by the band’s guitarist, Denys Burlaka.</p>
